  abstract = {Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.},

This paper explores the implementation of an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, designed to improve manufacturing quality control by utilizing the capabilities of LLMs, particularly OpenAI’s GPT models. We focus on the ceramic tile manufacturing process, where the system retrieves and analyzes specialized bibliographic sources to diagnose defects and propose solutions. In addition to core RAG functionalities, the system incorporates tailored pre-processing and post-processing mechanisms to optimize document retrieval and response generation. The system’s effectiveness in solving quality issues is demonstrated through its application in identifying defect causes and generating actionable solutions, significantly improving non-conformities management. This approach not only streamlines troubleshooting but also enhances the quality control system, providing a comprehensive, scalable tool for manufacturers.},

  abstract = {This book is an introductory text on design science, intended to support both graduate students and researchers in structuring, undertaking and presenting design science work. It builds on established design science methods as well as recent work on presenting design science studies and ethical principles for design science, and also offers novel instruments for visualizing the results, both in the form of process diagrams and through a canvas format. While the book does not presume any prior knowledge of design science, it provides readers with a thorough understanding of the subject and enables them to delve into much deeper detail, thanks to extensive sections on further reading. Design science in information systems and technology aims to create novel artifacts in the form of models, methods, and systems that support people in developing, using and maintaining IT solutions. This work focuses on design science as applied to information systems and technology, but it also includes examples from, and perspectives of, other fields of human practice. Chapter 1 provides an overview of design science and outlines its ties with empirical research. Chapter 2 discusses the various types and forms of knowledge that can be used and produced by design science research, while Chapter 3 presents a brief overview of common empirical research strategies and methods. Chapter 4 introduces a methodological framework for supporting researchers in doing design science research as well as in presenting their results. This framework includes five core activities, which are described in detail in Chapters 5 to 9. Chapter 10 discusses how to communicate design science results, while Chapter 11 compares the proposed methodological framework with methods for systems development and shows how they can be combined. Chapter 12 discusses how design science relates to research paradigms, in particular to positivism and interpretivism, and Chapter 13 discusses ethical issues and principles for design science research. The new Chapter 14 showcases a study on digital health consultations and illustrates the whole process in one comprehensive example. Also added to this 2nd edition are a number of sections on practical guidelines for carrying out basic design science tasks, a discussion on design thinking and its relationship to design science, and the description of artefact classifications. Eventually, both the references in each chapter and the companion web site were updated to reflect recent findings.},

This study introduces Document Graph RAG (GraphRAG), a novel framework that bolsters retrieval robustness and enhances answer generation by incorporating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) built upon a document’s intrinsic structure into the RAG pipeline. Through the application of the Design Science Research methodology, we systematically design, implement, and evaluate GraphRAG, leveraging graph-based document structuring and a keyword-based semantic linking mechanism to improve retrieval quality. The evaluation, conducted on well-established datasets including SQuAD, HotpotQA, and a newly developed manufacturing dataset, demonstrates consistent performance gains over a naive RAG baseline across both retrieval and generation metrics. The results indicate that GraphRAG improves Context Relevance metrics, with task-dependent optimizations for chunk size, keyword density, and top-k retrieval further enhancing performance. Notably, multi-hop questions benefit most from GraphRAG’s structured retrieval strategy, highlighting its advantages in complex reasoning tasks.},

  abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

Using Hyundai Staria maintenance documents as a case study, we extracted text and images from PDF manuals and constructed QA, RAG, and Multi-Turn datasets to reflect realistic troubleshooting scenarios. To overcome limitations of baseline RAG models, we proposed an enhanced architecture that incorporates sentence-level similarity annotations and parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) using the bLLossom-8B language model and BAAI-bge-m3 embedding model. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieved improvements of 3.0\%p in BERTScore, 3.0\%p in cosine similarity, and 18.0\%p in ROUGE-L compared to existing RAG systems, with notable gains in image-guided response accuracy. A qualitative evaluation by 20 domain experts yielded an average satisfaction score of 4.4 out of 5.

An AI assistant guides the analyst through a specific data wrangling task by recommending a suitable data transformation that respects the constraints obtained through interaction with the analyst. We formally define the structure of AI assistants and describe how existing tools that treat data cleaning as an optimization problem fit the definition. We implement AI assistants for four common data wrangling tasks and make AI assistants easily accessible to data analysts in an open-source notebook environment for data science, by leveraging the common structure they follow. We evaluate our AI assistants both quantitatively and qualitatively through three example scenarios. We show that the unified and interactive design makes it easy to perform tasks that would be difficult to do manually or with a fully automatic tool.},

Enterprises will face stringent requirements when complying with the EU AIA, which many organizations currently find confusing. This study aims to identify key challenges and strategy development that organizations face regarding the EU AIA and to help them comply with it. To achieve this aim, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) to explore the sentiments of both the industry and the academia. From 130 articles, 56 met our criteria. We found 199 primary keywords in the literature. The three following concepts were the key ones: liability, discrimination, and a adequacy of tool. Additionally, both industry and academia expressed negative sentiments around regulatory interpretations, specific requirements, and transparency issues. Based on our findings, we highlight three themes for enterprises. First, a risk-based regulatory compliance system, emphasizing the importance of developing systems that ensure adherence to regulatory requirements by focusing on risk management. Second, the need for ethical frameworks and principles in technology development. Third, the importance of policies and systems regulatory risk management. These results highlight key challenges and strategies, while also highlighting less commonly discussed themes, thus enabling enterprises to align their systems with the requirements and better position themselves in relation to the EU market.},

The objective of the first chapter of this book is to provide an introduction to PLM, answering the questions: “What is PLM?”; “Why PLM?”; “When did PLM appear”; and “Where is PLM used?” This will help those working with PLM in a company, including those involved in a company’s PLM Initiative, to understand the basics of PLM and why it’s so important. It will allow them to participate more fully in the PLM Initiative and PLM activities. This chapter also aims to give students a basic understanding of PLM and its importance in industry. The first part of the chapter gives definitions of PLM, a PLM Initiative, and the PLM Paradigm. The second part of the chapter looks at the meaning of the letters P, L and M in the PLM acronym. The third part addresses the scope of PLM. It introduces the PLM Grid, describes activities within the scope of PLM; and identifies the resources managed in PLM. The fourth part of the chapter describes the PLM Paradigm, detailing concepts, consequences and corollaries. The fifth part looks at the potential benefits, strategic and operational, of PLM and a PLM Initiative. The sixth part shows how PLM has spread since its emergence in 2001. As of 2015, it’s used throughout manufacturing industry and throughout the world. The seventh and final part of the chapter looks at the problems that PLM solves and the opportunities it enables.},

  abstract = {This second volume moves beyond~a general introduction to product lifecycle management (PLM) and its principal elements to provide a more in-depth analysis of the subjects introduced in Volume 1 (21st Century Paradigm for Product Realisation). Providing insights into the emergence of PLM and the opportunities it offers, key concepts such as the PLM Grid and the PLM Paradigm are introduced along with the main components of PLM and the associated characteristics, issues and approaches. Detailing the 10 components of PLM: objectives and metrics; management and organisation; business processes; people; product data; PDM systems; other PLM applications; facilities and equipment; methods; and products, it provides examples and best practices. The book concludes with instructions to help readers implement and use PLM successfully, including outlining the phases of a PLM Initiative: development of PLM vision and strategy; documentation of the current situation; description of future scenarios; development of implementation strategies and plans; implementation and use. The main activities, tasks, methods, timing and tools of the different phases are also described.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances in generic question-answering (QA) but often suffer from domain gaps and outdated knowledge in smart manufacturing (SM). Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based on LLMs has emerged as a potential approach by incorporating an external knowledge base. However, conventional vector-based RAG delivers rapid responses but often returns contextually vague results, while knowledge graph (KG)-based methods offer structured relational reasoning at the expense of scalability and efficiency. To address these challenges, a hybrid KG-Vector RAG framework that systematically integrates structured KG metadata with unstructured vector retrieval is proposed. Firstly, a metadata-enriched KG was constructed from domain corpora by systematically extracting and indexing structured information to capture essential domain-specific relationships. Secondly, semantic alignment was achieved by injecting domain-specific constraints to refine and enhance the contextual relevance of the knowledge representations. Lastly, a layered hybrid retrieval strategy was employed that combined the explicit reasoning capabilities of the KG with the efficient search power of vector-based similarity methods, and the resulting outputs were integrated via prompt engineering to generate comprehensive, context-aware responses. Evaluated on design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) tasks, the proposed approach achieved 77.8\% exact match accuracy and 76.5\% context precision. This study establishes a new paradigm for industrial LLM systems, which demonstrates that hybrid symbolic-neural architectures can overcome the precision-scalability trade-off in mission-critical manufacturing applications. Experimental results indicated that integrating structured KG information with vector-based retrieval and prompt engineering can enhance retrieval accuracy, contextual relevance, and efficiency in LLM-based Q\&A systems for SM.},

  abstract = {Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) technology receives extensive attention in the manufacturing field. As the core technology, it generates considerable interest among smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 strategy. Product lifecycle management (PLM) copes with various kinds of engineering, business, and management activities concerning a product throughout its whole lifecycle—from the inception of an intangible concept through the recycling of a finished product. In the context of smart manufacturing, this paper reviews various theories, algorithms, and technologies of AI to different stages of PLM (i.e., product design, manufacturing, and service). A structured roadmap is presented to navigate the future research and application of AI in PLM. This paper also discusses the opportunities and challenges of applying AI for PLM.},
