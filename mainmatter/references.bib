	abstract = {Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models ({LLMs}) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation ({RAG}), an ad hoc approach that augments {LMs} with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes {LM} versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-{RAG}) that enhances an {LM}'s quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary {LM} that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the {LM} controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-{RAG} (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art {LLMs} and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-{RAG} outperforms {ChatGPT} and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain {QA}, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.},

	abstract = {As semiconductor manufacturing complexity escalates, the intricacy of corresponding manufacturing systems intensifies. These extensive systems necessitate diverse engineering expertise for effective operation and analysis. For instance, yield engineers analyze yield systems, process engineers interpret {FDC} parameters, and equipment engineers monitor device equipment health. Traditional manufacturing systems, reliant on manual data analysis and fixed algorithms, suffer from slow decision-making and limited adaptability. They are susceptible to human error, reactive maintenance, and restricted user interaction confined to technical interfaces and business hours. Additionally, scalability and integration pose significant challenges, inflating operational costs and hampering resource efficiency. This letter introduces an Intelligent Manufacturing Virtual Assistant ({IMVA}) specifically designed for the semiconductor industry. By harnessing the power of Large Language Models ({LLMs}) and {AI} Agents, {IMVA} enhances yield analysis and seamlessly integrates with existing systems and tools. It exhibits high accuracy in defect detection through advanced data analysis and report generation. Furthermore, {IMVA} facilitates natural language interaction, rendering it user-friendly and accessible to non-technical personnel. Consequently, {IMVA} markedly improve operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional manufacturing systems. The efficacy of {IMVA} is demonstrated through the Wide-bandgap ({WBG}) process, showcasing its capability to simplify root cause analysis and provide comprehensive yield reports.},

	abstract = {Product Lifecycle Management ({PLM}) is the business activity of managing, in the most effective way, a company’s products all the way across their lifecycles; from the very first idea for a product all the way through until it is retired and disposed of. The objective of the first chapter of this book is to provide an introduction to {PLM}, answering the questions: “What is {PLM}?”; “Why {PLM}?”; “When did {PLM} appear”; and “Where is {PLM} used?” This will help those working with {PLM} in a company, including those involved in a company’s {PLM} Initiative, to understand the basics of {PLM} and why it’s so important. It will allow them to participate more fully in the {PLM} Initiative and {PLM} activities. This chapter also aims to give students a basic understanding of {PLM} and its importance in industry. The first part of the chapter gives definitions of {PLM}, a {PLM} Initiative, and the {PLM} Paradigm. The second part of the chapter looks at the meaning of the letters P, L and M in the {PLM} acronym. The third part addresses the scope of {PLM}. It introduces the {PLM} Grid, describes activities within the scope of {PLM}; and identifies the resources managed in {PLM}. The fourth part of the chapter describes the {PLM} Paradigm, detailing concepts, consequences and corollaries. The fifth part looks at the potential benefits, strategic and operational, of {PLM} and a {PLM} Initiative. The sixth part shows how {PLM} has spread since its emergence in 2001. As of 2015, it’s used throughout manufacturing industry and throughout the world. The seventh and final part of the chapter looks at the problems that {PLM} solves and the opportunities it enables.},

	abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream {NLP} tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation ({RAG}) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce {RAG} models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two {RAG} formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive {NLP} tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain {QA} tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that {RAG} models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

We introduce {AI} assistants, a class of semi-automatic interactive tools to streamline data wrangling. An {AI} assistant guides the analyst through a specific data wrangling task by recommending a suitable data transformation that respects the constraints obtained through interaction with the analyst. We formally define the structure of {AI} assistants and describe how existing tools that treat data cleaning as an optimization problem fit the definition. We implement {AI} assistants for four common data wrangling tasks and make {AI} assistants easily accessible to data analysts in an open-source notebook environment for data science, by leveraging the common structure they follow. We evaluate our {AI} assistants both quantitatively and qualitatively through three example scenarios. We show that the unified and interactive design makes it easy to perform tasks that would be difficult to do manually or with a fully automatic tool.},

	abstract = {In the domain of Chinese clinical medical question-answering ({QA}), traditional Large Language Models ({LLMs}) encounter challenges such as hallucinations and difficulties in updating knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks. To address these issues, this research presents a Chinese clinical medical {QA} model that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation ({RAG}) and a medical knowledge graph, named {CMedRAGBot}. First, a Chinese medical knowledge graph encompassing multiple entity types—including diseases, medications, and symptoms—is constructed. Based on this knowledge graph, a Named Entity Recognition ({NER}) model built on a Chinese-{RoBERTa} and {BiGRU} architecture is designed, with data augmentation strategies employed to enhance its generalization capability. In addition, prompt engineering techniques are used to implement intent recognition for user queries, mapping them to predefined intent categories. Finally, the aforementioned modules are integrated to form a complete Chinese clinical medical {QA} system. In the experimental evaluation, {CMedRAGBot} is deployed on five state-of-the-art {LLMs} (including {ChatGPT}-4o, {ChatGPT}-o1, {DeepSeek}-R1, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) and tested using specialized question banks derived from the Chinese Clinical Medical Qualification Examinations and Residency Standardization Training Examinations from 2000 to 2023. The results indicate that the integration of {CMedRAGBot} significantly improves the test accuracy of all models, with increases of up to approximately 10\%. Furthermore, ablation experiments reveal that data augmentation enhances {NER} model’s F1 score from 95.27\% to 97.55\%, while the inclusion of an intent recognition module markedly improves the model’s ability to understand complex queries, thereby further boosting answer accuracy.

Chapter 1 provides an overview of design science and outlines its ties with empirical research. Chapter 2 discusses the various types and forms of knowledge that can be used and produced by design science research, while Chapter 3 presents a brief overview of common empirical research strategies and methods. Chapter 4 introduces a methodological framework for supporting researchers in doing design science research as well as in presenting their results. This framework includes five core activities, which are described in detail in Chapters 5 to 9. Chapter 10 discusses how to communicate design science results, while Chapter 11 compares the proposed methodological framework with methods for systems development and shows how they can be combined. Chapter 12 discusses how design science relates to research paradigms, in particular to positivism and interpretivism, and Chapter 13 discusses ethical issues and principles for design science research. The new Chapter 14 showcases a study on digital health consultations and illustrates the whole process in one comprehensive example. Also added to this 2nd edition are a number of sections on practical guidelines for carrying out basic design science tasks, a discussion on design thinking and its relationship to design science, and the description of artefact classifications. Eventually, both the references in each chapter and the companion web site were updated to reflect recent findings.},
