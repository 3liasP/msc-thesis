	abstract = {Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models ({LLMs}) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation ({RAG}), an ad hoc approach that augments {LMs} with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes {LM} versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-{RAG}) that enhances an {LM}'s quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary {LM} that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the {LM} controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-{RAG} (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art {LLMs} and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-{RAG} outperforms {ChatGPT} and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain {QA}, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.},

Using Hyundai Staria maintenance documents as a case study, we extracted text and images from {PDF} manuals and constructed {QA}, {RAG}, and Multi-Turn datasets to reflect realistic troubleshooting scenarios. To overcome limitations of baseline {RAG} models, we proposed an enhanced architecture that incorporates sentence-level similarity annotations and parameter-efficient fine-tuning via {LoRA} (Low-Rank Adaptation) using the {bLLossom}-8B language model and {BAAI}-bge-m3 embedding model. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieved improvements of 3.0\%p in {BERTScore}, 3.0\%p in cosine similarity, and 18.0\%p in {ROUGE}-L compared to existing {RAG} systems, with notable gains in image-guided response accuracy. A qualitative evaluation by 20 domain experts yielded an average satisfaction score of 4.4 out of 5. This study presents a practical and extensible {AI} framework for multimodal document understanding, with broad applicability across automotive, industrial, and defense-related technical documentation.},

	abstract = {Product Lifecycle Management ({PLM}) is the business activity of managing, in the most effective way, a company’s products all the way across their lifecycles; from the very first idea for a product all the way through until it is retired and disposed of. The objective of the first chapter of this book is to provide an introduction to {PLM}, answering the questions: “What is {PLM}?”; “Why {PLM}?”; “When did {PLM} appear”; and “Where is {PLM} used?” This will help those working with {PLM} in a company, including those involved in a company’s {PLM} Initiative, to understand the basics of {PLM} and why it’s so important. It will allow them to participate more fully in the {PLM} Initiative and {PLM} activities. This chapter also aims to give students a basic understanding of {PLM} and its importance in industry. The first part of the chapter gives definitions of {PLM}, a {PLM} Initiative, and the {PLM} Paradigm. The second part of the chapter looks at the meaning of the letters P, L and M in the {PLM} acronym. The third part addresses the scope of {PLM}. It introduces the {PLM} Grid, describes activities within the scope of {PLM}; and identifies the resources managed in {PLM}. The fourth part of the chapter describes the {PLM} Paradigm, detailing concepts, consequences and corollaries. The fifth part looks at the potential benefits, strategic and operational, of {PLM} and a {PLM} Initiative. The sixth part shows how {PLM} has spread since its emergence in 2001. As of 2015, it’s used throughout manufacturing industry and throughout the world. The seventh and final part of the chapter looks at the problems that {PLM} solves and the opportunities it enables.},

	abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream {NLP} tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation ({RAG}) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce {RAG} models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two {RAG} formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive {NLP} tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain {QA} tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that {RAG} models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

We introduce {AI} assistants, a class of semi-automatic interactive tools to streamline data wrangling. An {AI} assistant guides the analyst through a specific data wrangling task by recommending a suitable data transformation that respects the constraints obtained through interaction with the analyst. We formally define the structure of {AI} assistants and describe how existing tools that treat data cleaning as an optimization problem fit the definition. We implement {AI} assistants for four common data wrangling tasks and make {AI} assistants easily accessible to data analysts in an open-source notebook environment for data science, by leveraging the common structure they follow. We evaluate our {AI} assistants both quantitatively and qualitatively through three example scenarios. We show that the unified and interactive design makes it easy to perform tasks that would be difficult to do manually or with a fully automatic tool.},

It builds on established design science methods as well as recent work on presenting design science studies and ethical principles for design science, and also offers novel instruments for visualizing the results, both in the form of process diagrams and through a canvas format. While the book does not presume any prior knowledge of design science, it provides readers with a thorough understanding of the subject and enables them to delve into much deeper detail, thanks to extensive sections on further reading. Design science in information systems and technology aims to create novel artifacts in the form of models, methods, and systems that support people in developing, using and maintaining {IT} solutions. This work focuses on design science as applied to information systems and technology, but it also includes examples from, and perspectives of, other fields of human practice. Chapter 1 provides an overview of design science and outlines its ties with empirical research. Chapter 2 discusses the various types and forms of knowledge that can be used and produced by design science research, while Chapter 3 presents a brief overview of common empirical research strategies and methods. Chapter 4 introduces a methodological framework for supporting researchers in doing design science research as well as in presenting their results. This framework includes five core activities, which are described in detail in Chapters 5 to 9. Chapter 10 discusses how to communicate design science results, while Chapter 11 compares the proposed methodological framework with methods for systems development and shows how they can be combined. Chapter 12 discusses how design science relates to research paradigms, in particular to positivism and interpretivism, and Chapter 13 discusses ethical issues and principles for design science research. The new Chapter 14 showcases a study on digital health consultations and illustrates the whole process in one comprehensive example. Also added to this 2nd edition are a number of sections on practical guidelines for carrying out basic design science tasks, a discussion on design thinking and its relationship to design science, and the description of artefact classifications. Eventually, both the references in each chapter and the companion web site were updated to reflect recent findings.},

Through the application of the Design Science Research methodology, we systematically design, implement, and evaluate {GraphRAG}, leveraging graph-based document structuring and a keyword-based semantic linking mechanism to improve retrieval quality. The evaluation, conducted on well-established datasets including {SQuAD}, {HotpotQA}, and a newly developed manufacturing dataset, demonstrates consistent performance gains over a naive {RAG} baseline across both retrieval and generation metrics. The results indicate that {GraphRAG} improves Context Relevance metrics, with task-dependent optimizations for chunk size, keyword density, and top-k retrieval further enhancing performance.

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have shown remarkable performances in generic question-answering ({QA}) but often suffer from domain gaps and outdated knowledge in smart manufacturing ({SM}). Retrieval-augmented generation ({RAG}) based on {LLMs} has emerged as a potential approach by incorporating an external knowledge base. However, conventional vector-based {RAG} delivers rapid responses but often returns contextually vague results, while knowledge graph ({KG})-based methods offer structured relational reasoning at the expense of scalability and efficiency. To address these challenges, a hybrid {KG}-Vector {RAG} framework that systematically integrates structured {KG} metadata with unstructured vector retrieval is proposed. Firstly, a metadata-enriched {KG} was constructed from domain corpora by systematically extracting and indexing structured information to capture essential domain-specific relationships. Secondly, semantic alignment was achieved by injecting domain-specific constraints to refine and enhance the contextual relevance of the knowledge representations. Lastly, a layered hybrid retrieval strategy was employed that combined the explicit reasoning capabilities of the {KG} with the efficient search power of vector-based similarity methods, and the resulting outputs were integrated via prompt engineering to generate comprehensive, context-aware responses. Evaluated on design for additive manufacturing ({DfAM}) tasks, the proposed approach achieved 77.8\% exact match accuracy and 76.5\% context precision. This study establishes a new paradigm for industrial {LLM} systems, which demonstrates that hybrid symbolic-neural architectures can overcome the precision-scalability trade-off in mission-critical manufacturing applications. Experimental results indicated that integrating structured {KG} information with vector-based retrieval and prompt engineering can enhance retrieval accuracy, contextual relevance, and efficiency in {LLM}-based Q\&A systems for {SM}.},
