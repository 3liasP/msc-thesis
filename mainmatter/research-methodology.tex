\section{Design Science Methodology}
\label{sec:design-science-methodology}

Design Science Methodology (DSM) is a research approach that focuses on the creation and evaluation of artifacts designed to solve identified problems. In this thesis, we employ DSM to develop an AI assistant integrated with a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system. The methodology involves iterative cycles of problem identification, artifact design, development, and evaluation.

\section{Case Study Approach}
\label{sec:case-study-approach}

A case study approach is utilized to provide an in-depth understanding of the integration of the AI assistant with the PLM system. This approach allows for the exploration of real-world contexts and the examination of the interactions between the AI assistant and users within the PLM environment. Data is collected through observations, interviews, and system usage logs to assess the effectiveness and usability of the integrated solution.
