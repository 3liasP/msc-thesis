\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{ch:literature-review}

In this chapter, we review the existing literature relevant to our research topic. We explore various theories, models, and empirical studies that have contributed to the understanding of the subject matter.

\section{Overview of PLM systems and AI assistants}
\label{sec:plm-systems-and-ai-assistants}

Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems are integral to managing the entire lifecycle of a product from inception, through engineering design and manufacturing, to service and disposal. They provide a centralized repository for all product-related information, facilitating collaboration among different departments and stakeholders.

\section{Resource-augmented AI systems}
\label{sec:resource-augmented-ai-systems}

Resource-augmented AI systems leverage external resources to enhance their capabilities. These systems can access databases, knowledge graphs, and other information repositories to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

\section{Case studies on similar integrations}
\label{sec:case-studies-on-similar-integrations}

Several case studies have explored the integration of AI assistants with PLM systems. These studies demonstrate the potential benefits of such integrations, including improved efficiency, enhanced decision-making, and better collaboration among stakeholders. By examining these case studies, we can identify best practices and key considerations for implementing similar solutions in our research.
