\chapter{Evaluation and Results}
\label{ch:evaluation-and-results}

\textit{In this chapter, we present the evaluation of the AI assistant integrated with the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system. We discuss the methodologies used for evaluation, the metrics considered, and the results obtained from various tests and user feedback.}

\section{Testing and Validation of Chatbot Functionality}
\label{sec:testing-and-validation-of-chatbot-functionality}

\textit{The chatbot functionality was tested through a series of scenarios that mimic real-world interactions within the PLM environment. These tests included both automated scripts and manual interactions by users familiar with the PLM system. The chatbot's ability to understand and respond to queries related to product data, documentation retrieval, and workflow assistance was evaluated.}

\section{User Feedback}
\label{sec:user-feedback}

\textit{User feedback was collected through surveys and interviews with a group of PLM system users who interacted with the AI assistant. The feedback focused on the usability, effectiveness, and overall satisfaction with the chatbot. Users were asked to rate their experience on various aspects, including response accuracy, ease of use, and the helpfulness of the information provided.}
