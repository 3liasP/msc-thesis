%%%%% Abstracts and preface.
%
% Write the abstract(s) and the preface into a separate file for the sake of
% clarity. Pass the appropriate file name as the first argument to these
% commands. Put the \abstract in the primary language first and the
% \otherabstract in the secondary language second. Those who do not speak
% Finnish only need the first abstract. The second argument of the \preface
% command takes the place where the thesis was signed in.
%
% Edit the files tex/{use-of-ai-en, use-of-ai-fi}.tex to match your use of AI in
% generating this thesis.
